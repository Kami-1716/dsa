# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript

## Introduction

Welcome to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript! This repository is a collection of my notes, code snippets, and practice problems as I delve into the world of DSA. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your skills, I hope this repository serves as a helpful resource.

## Why Learn DSA?

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that help solve problems efficiently and become a better computer scientist ultimately. Understanding DSA is essential for:

- **Optimizing Code**: Write efficient and scalable code.
- **Problem Solving**: Approach and solve complex problems systematically.
- **Interviews**: DSA is a critical component of technical interviews.
- **Building a Strong Foundation**: Gain a deep understanding of how data is organized and manipulated.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand Core Data Structures**: Learn how to implement and use arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Master Algorithms**: Explore sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph traversal algorithms.
- **Analyze Time and Space Complexity**: Learn to calculate the efficiency of algorithms using Big-O notation.
- **Solve Practice Problems**: Apply the concepts through coding challenges and problem-solving.
